# ControlDeck
NES emulation. Experiments in NES hardware simulation of 6502, PPU.

# Main goals
* Understand and simulate the NES hardware using system documentation.
* Separate CPU instruction execution from system clock to enable testability while attempting to match the exact instruction timing behavior
* Support PPU/OpenGL rendering interface to allow simulation of rendering process down to the individual scan line (WIP).
